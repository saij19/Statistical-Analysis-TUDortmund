## Statistical Analysis of Passing Rate and Game Outcomes from Bundesliga

This project delves into: *Does passing rate significantly influence the outcome of a soccer game?* 
This report analysed data on passing rates and game results to uncover potential correlations.

**Introduction**

Soccer, also known as football, captivates billions of fans worldwide. With its simple rules and fast-paced action, it transcends cultural barriers to become a global phenomenon. Beyond the entertainment value, soccer is a multi-billion dollar industry, with leagues generating vast revenue through broadcasting rights. Understanding the factors influencing success in this highly competitive sport is not just a matter of fan curiosity, but holds significant strategic and financial implications.

One crucial aspect of soccer is passing, the art of accurately transferring the ball between players. Passing not only facilitates ball movement but also creates scoring opportunities and disrupts the opponent's game plan. However, the exact relationship between passing and winning outcomes remains a subject of debate.
This project delves into this very question: Does passing rate significantly influence the outcome of a soccer game? This report analysed data on passing rates and game results to uncover potential correlations.

The analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in passing rates between winning and losing teams. Teams with higher passing rates emerged victorious more often, suggesting a positive link between efficient passing and securing wins. However, the effect size, a measure of the strength of this association, was small. This implies that successful soccer gameplay likely involves a complex interplay of factors beyond just passing proficiency.

While passing seems to be a contributing factor, the story doesn't end there. Investigation identified no significant difference in passing rates between winning and tie games. This hints that other factors beyond passing excellence might play a more prominent role in determining the outcome of a tie game.

**Research Questions**

This report investigates passing rates to understand its impact in soccer matches. This statistical analysis aims to address the following research questions – 

- Research Question 1 – Is there a statistically significant difference in the average passing rate between winning and tie games?
- Research Question 2 – Is there a larger difference in passing rates within winning games compared to tie games?

**Conclusion and Summary**

1. Do winning teams have a statistically different passing rate compared to losing teams? 
- Key Result – Yes, there's a significant difference (p-value < 0.05) in passing rates. Winning teams boast a higher median passing rate, suggesting a connection between successful passing and winning. However, the effect size was small, indicating other factors likely influence winning besides passing.

2.	Is the difference in passing rate larger within winning games compared to ties?
- Key Result – No significant difference (p > 0.05) was found in passing rates between winning and tie games. This suggests passing rate may not be a major factor distinguishing wins from ties. In other words, teams with both high and lower passing rates can emerge victorious in games that end in a tie. This finding highlights the complex nature of game outcomes, where various factors beyond passing success can contribute to a tied result.

Overall, the findings suggest that passing rate is a factor influencing game outcomes, with higher passing rates associated with winning teams. However, the difference in passing rates between winning and tie games seems negligible. 

Future scope of this report could include further research exploring other factors potentially influencing game outcomes alongside passing rate.
